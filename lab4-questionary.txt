=== This template file contains questions you need to answer.
=== Fill your answers on appropriate blank lines only.
=== Don't start any line with three equal signs "===".
=== Don't edit any lines starting from three equal signs.
=== Use C notation to write numbers: 42 for decimal, 0x2a for hexadecimal.
=== We may check most of the answers automatically, so "forty two" or
=== "26+16" won't work for this example. Spaces are mostly ignored, so
=== "  42  " is OK (without quotes of course). 
=== When asked to specify address & instruction, do it in the form of
=== gdb output "ADDRESS: INSTRUCTION", for example "0x7c26:  or  $0x1,%eax"
=== Don't make lines longer than 80 characters. You don't need to fit your
=== answer in a single line, you can start a new line at will.
=== However, when asked to fill "a table" make each table raw a singleline.

=== Q Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. Bearing in
===   mind that kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE
===   just like everything else in the kernel, what is the purpose of macro
===   MPBOOTPHYS? Why is it necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in
===   boot/boot.S? In other words, what could go wrong if it were
===   omitted in kern/mpentry.S?
===   (free form)

=== Q It seems that using the big kernel lock guarantees that only one
===   CPU can run the kernel code at a time. Why do we still need
===   separate kernel stacks for each CPU? Describe a scenario in
===   which using a shared kernel stack will go wrong, even with the
===   protection of the big kernel lock.
===   (free form)

=== Q Whenever the kernel switches from one environment to another, it
===   must ensure the old environment's registers are saved so they
===   can be restored properly later. Where does this happen?
===   (JOS function name)

=== Q In your implementation of env_run() you should have called
===   lcr3(). Before and after the call to lcr3(), your code makes
===   references (at least it should) to the variable e, the argument
===   to env_run. Upon loading the %cr3 register, the addressing
===   context used by the MMU is instantly changed. But a virtual
===   address (namely e) has meaning relative to a given address 
===   context--the address context specifies the physical address to
===   which the virtual address maps. Why can the pointer e be
===   dereferenced both before and after the addressing switch?
===   (one sentence, free form)

=== Q In Ex. 4, what happens if the user environment runs out of
===   space on the exception stack?
===   (one setence, free form)

=== Q In dumpfork.c, the first time you call duppage(), the function
===   allocates a page in one environment (env A) and then maps it in
===   another (env B). At whataddress is the page mapped in env A, and
===   at what address is it mapped in env B?
===   (ADDR(in env A):ADDR(in env B) (example: 0xAAAAAAAA:0xBBBBBBBB)

====================================================================
=== Q What challenge(s) have you chosen to implement? (specify
===   challenge numbers separated by spaces, if more than one)

=== Q If the challenge requires changing the kernel source, list the
===   files which you have changed/added during implementation.
===   (one file per line, relative to lab directory containing .git/)
inc/env.h
kern/sched.c
=== Q Describe you solution.
===   (free form, up to 500 words, don't need to use all 500!)
Added a priority field (integer) to struct Env in evn.h. The higher this integer is set, the better (the scheduler will pick the enviroment before others). Changed sched_yield to take this into account.
