=== This template file contains questions you need to answer.
=== Fill your answers on appropriate blank lines only.
=== Don't start any line with three equal signs "===".
=== Don't edit any lines starting from three equal signs.
=== Use C notation to write numbers: 42 for decimal, 0x2a for hexadecimal.
=== We may check most of the answers automatically, so "forty two" or
=== "26+16" won't work for this example. Spaces are mostly ignored, so
=== "  42  " is OK (without quotes of course). 
=== When asked to specify address & instruction, do it in the form of
=== gdb output "ADDRESS: INSTRUCTION", for example "0x7c26:  or  $0x1,%eax"
=== Don't make lines longer than 80 characters. You don't need to fit your
=== answer in a single line, you can start a new line at will.

===   (remove leading "====" from the correct answer line)
==== hard coded in boot loader
elf header
==== elf tail
==== gnome header
==== gnome tail
==== none of above

=== Q What C function in boot loader contains the logic of reading the
===   whole kernel? (not full function declaration, just the name)

===   (as displayed by gdb, in the form WORD1 WORD2 WORD3 WORD4)
0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
=== Q What are 4 words of memory at 0x100000 at the point the boot
===   loader enters the kernel?
===   (as displayed by gdb, in the form WORD1 WORD2 WORD3 WORD4)
0x1badb002 0x00000000 0xe4524ffe 0x7205c766

entry.S
=== Q Study the file you've just found.
===   What's the name of a kernel entry point as appears in this file?
_start
=== Q What line among all kernel sources declares the name you've just
===   found as kernel entry point? (full line)
.globl		_start
=== Q What's the first instruction which would "break" if you were to
===   get the boot loader's link address wrong? "Break" here means: 
===   the result of executing the instruction is different from the
===   one before the change of the link address.
===   Check yourself by recompiling & debugging!
===   (address & instruction)
0x7c2d:  ljmp  $0x8,$0x7c32
=== Q What's the first instruction after the kernel establishes a new
===   mapping that would fail to work properly if the mappings were
===   not in place? (address & instruction)
+0x100028:  mov  $0xf010002f,%eax

cputchar
=== Q What is the task of console.c lines 194-202?
===   (free form, up to 10 words)
make room for a new line in the console
===   Consider the code
===   	int x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;
===	cprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", x, y, z);
===   executing inside cprintf function just after fmt and ap are
===   initialized (just before the call to vcprintf).

=== Q What's the contents of the first byte in memory pointed to by
===   fmt? (write this byte as a number)
